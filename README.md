# üêü Fish Freshness Detection using Deep Learning


This project investigates the use of deep learning architectures including VGG16, Vision Transformer (ViT), and a hybrid VGG16-ViT model. This project use these deep learning models to automatically classify fish freshness based on eye image data. It addresses the real-world challenge of subjective and labor-intensive fish freshness assessment, offering a foundation for developing scalable, AI-driven quality control solutions in the seafood industry.

# üìò Project Summary


Ensuring the freshness of fish is critical for public health, food safety, and minimizing economic losses in seafood logistics. Traditional inspection methods are often subjective and inconsistent. In this project, we employ computer vision and transfer learning techniques to automate freshness detection using eye images from The Freshness of Fish Eyes Dataset.

The classification task categorizes images into three classes:
<ul>
<li>Highly Fresh</li>

<li>Fresh</li>

<li>Not Fresh</li>
</ul>

Despite class imbalances and subtle visual differences, our models attempt to generalize across categories through data augmentation and fine-tuning.

# üî¨ Research Objectives


Develop a deep learning pipeline to classify fish freshness using fish eye images.

Compare performance across:

<ul>
<li>VGG16 (CNN-based)</li>

<li>Vision Transformer (ViT) (Transformer-based)</li>

<li>Hybrid VGG16-ViT model</li>

</ul>

Address dataset imbalance with augmentation.

Evaluate classification performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

# üß† Model Architectures


1. VGG16
A convolutional neural network with 16 layers, known for hierarchical feature extraction. Transfer learning with ImageNet weights is used.

2. Vision Transformer (ViT)
Processes image patches using self-attention mechanisms, capturing global image context and long-range dependencies.

3. Hybrid VGG16-ViT
Combines local feature extraction (VGG16) and global representation (ViT) through concatenated feature embeddings.
